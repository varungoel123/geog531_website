I am not an IT person, but I did manage to install these software packages on both his Mac and Windows computers. You can contact me if you are having issues, but please also feel free to reach out to USC IT desk for assistance.\nPlease note that GEOG 510 will not rely on ESRI software (ArcGIS or ArcPro). Instead, we will be using open-source software such as QGIS and R. The reasons for this change are many, but the most salient ones are 1) ESRI software still does not run on Mac computers (without the need for partitioning or installing a virtual machine), 2) the newest version of ESRI’s GIS software (ArcPro) is not as intuitive and is clunky (and QGIS has basically closed the gap on functionality and usability), and 3) GIS programming is becoming a required skill for just about any GIS user. Regardless of whatever software is used, the knowledge you gain in this course should not be tied to a specific software package."

Try a search such as, study area health data statistics. For example, michigan health data statistics. Other strings can be used such as, michigan reportable diseases data statistics.\nIf you are study a place in the US, you may want to try to include a “geography” identifer in the search, such as maryland county health data statistics, which turned up this link and this link which both appear very promising.\nIf you’ve already found spatial data and are trying to locate tabular data for a particular subject, use a search string with the word table and the geographic resolution (unit) of your spatial data included, e.g., study area topic unit table. For example, you could search for, england vaccination local authorities table.\nYou can also try this type of search for “country or region” data and add the government entity that would likely collect or distribute the data.

    "text": "For this assignment, you will be working through a series of QGIS training modules, which are designed to get you up to speed on spatial data and representation, working with QGIS, and some basic GIS functionality. Working through these will be important so the class can move into some of the more advanced topics and uses of GIS by the end of the semester.\nI suggest that you complete each module assigned, but make your own decision on how much time to spend on each part given your prior GIS experience. For those of you with absolutely no GIS experience, I suggest diving in headfirst and working through every single step (time spent now will pay off later). For those of you with moderate to good GIS skills, make sure that you are at least skimming the reading within the module and completing all of the steps to brush up and ensure that you fill in any holes in your GIS knowledge. For GIS power users, I would suggest that (at the very least) you read through each module to make sure that you are familiar with all the operations and terminology included in each."

Feel free to use the following prompts to guide your answer: Did you find the interface and layout intuitive? Were any portions of the modules difficult to complete or understand? Do you now feel confident in your ability to add/load data layers? Did anything surprise you about working in QGIS?\n2. Module 4.1 (4.1.6) requires you to export the map you created as a graphics file. Export your map as a .jpg file and insert it into your answer document.\n3. In your own words (100-200 words), summarize and compare/contrast “Project on the Fly” in QGIS and changing/modifying the CRS of a spatial data layer (see Module 6.1).\n4. Module 6.2 required you to create multiple buffers (and use them to implement a distance-based analysis). Think of a health- or health care-related analysis where integrating buffers (or distance-based analysis such as that presented in 6.2) may provide useful/interesting results. Use the format in 6.2.2 to list potential criteria for your analysis.\n5. Now that you have had some initial GIS experience, describe a health-related research topic or problem that interests you and how you think GIS and/or geographic thinking can/should be integrated. This description can be mostly theoretical if you have no prior GIS/Geography experience. Try to stretch your ideas past simply “mapping the data” and descriptive analysis to consider how it can be used in explanation, prediction, or intervention.

    "title": "Data Storage and Management",
    "section": "",
    "text": "An important part of learning GIS is understanding how files and digital data are stored and accessed by the GIS software. This short demonstration attempts to point out some of the particularities that you will encounter as you download, store, and manage spatial (and other) data files both within and outside the GIS software.\nThe data are available here for download if you would like to follow along. Download the file GEOG510_demo1_data.zip to your hard drive (note where you downloaded the file!) and unzip it.\nNote that throughout this document, I use the term “right click”. This means “control click” for Mac users!\n\n\nSpatial Data Layers/Files\n\nUsing Windows Explorer (NOT Internet Explorer) on Windows or Finder on Mac, navigate to the unzipped contents of GEOG510_demo1_data, click on the folder Relational/spatial, and view the files. What you are seeing is a single spatial data layer (a common but hopefully dying format known as a shapefile). Notice that the “stem” of the file names is the same for each file (with different file extensions or types). The data format has its own internal logic and GIS software knows how to handle these files.\nOpen QGIS. In the top menu, select Project | New. Locate the Browser panel. This is basically a simplistic file/folder manager within the QGIS environment. Navigate to the folder Relational/spatial. Notice the difference in how QGIS displays the shapefile tl_2016_06_tract_alb.shp (compared to Explorer or Finder). Right click on the layer and notice that there are a couple of “file management” type options available. Choose Layer Properties. Click on each tab.\nYou can also use the Browser panel to view/preview some non-spatial data file types. Navigate to Relational/attributes, right click on CA_kind_0015_clean_TCT_AllData.csv, and choose Layer Properties. This functionality can be highly useful if/when you are searching for the right file to use or if you have multiple csv files and cannot remember which one you need to work with.\nNow, in the Browser panel, navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Click the arrow next to CA_Vacc.gdb and note that it contains multiple layers (one spatial, one non-spatial). This spatial data type is called a geodatabase. It is like a container that can store multiple spatial data layers.\nIn Explorer or Finder, navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Notice that, at a file system level, a geodatabase is simply a folder containing .gdb in the folder name! Also note that the naming and organization structure of a geodatabase is quite complex (and not easy to understand).\nGo back to QGIS and, in the Browser panel, navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Click the arrow next to CA_vacc_geopackage.gpkg. This spatial data type is called a geopackage. It is like a container that can store multiple spatial data layers. This file has the same data contained within it as the geodatabase file.\nGo back to Explorer or Finder, navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Notice that, at a file system level, a geopackage is a single file.\n\n\nWhy is this important?\nGiven the semi complex nature of file/folder storage for spatial data layers, is very, very easy to make the files unusable if doing file/folder management manually using Explorer or Finder. If possible, use the Browser panel in QGIS to perform basic file/folder management duties. If using Explorer or Finder, take care to move all folders/files associated with each layer.\n\n\n\n\nData (non)Storage in QGIS\nAnother extremely important aspect of using QGIS is understanding how GIS software interacts with spatial (and other) data layers when performing mapping and analysis. There are two extremely important concepts to learn,\n\nWhen you add a data layer to the Layers panel of QGIS, this is simply creating a link to where the layer is stored on your hard drive. The data layer does not move on your computer. The contents of the layer are not stored inside of QGIS. The software simply creates a link to the layer’s location.\nA QGIS project file (.qgz) can be used to save display properties, layer order, map layouts, and preferences… but it does not contain/store the actual spatial data layers.\n\n\nIn QGIS, add Object_Rel/CA_Vacc_geopackage.gpkg/tl_2016_06_tract_alb to the Layers panel using drag and drop from the Browser panel. If you get a pop up window asking about the geographic transformation, choose the default option. The layer should display in the map panel.\nIn the Layers panel, right click on tl_2016_06_tract_alb and choose Properties. If the Information tab (on the left) is not selected, click on it. Note that the Path to the file containing the data is shown (along with other basic information about the data). Click OK on the Layer Properties window.\nIn the top menu, choose Project | Save As. Save as File_paths_test.qgz in the Object_Rel folder.\nClose QGIS.\nGo to Explorer or Finder and navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Move the file File_paths_test.qgz from the Object_Rel folder to the Relational folder.\nOnce it is moved, double click on File_paths_test.qgz. You should get a pop up window named Handle Unavailable Layers. Click on tl_2016_06_tract_alb and click the Browse button. Navigate to Object_Rel and click on CA_Vacc_geopackage.gpkg. Click Apply Changes.\n\n\nWhat happened?\nWhen File_paths_test.qgz was moved on the hard drive, the link between this file and the data layers was broken. Remember, when adding a layer, QGIS only creates a link to the layer’s location. As such, if either the .qgz or the data layers file is moved, this link will be broken! QGIS uses relative file paths, meaning the data location are stored in relation to where the .qgz file is stored. In this case, as long as the file path between from the .qgz file to the spatial data layer files is not changed, the software will always be able to find the file.\n\n\n\nIn the top menu, choose Project | Save. Close QGIS.\nIn Explorer or Finder create a new folder called QGIS_test and move the Object_Rel and Relational folders inside of this new folder. Navigate to the Relational folder and double click on File_paths_test.qgz. What happened and why?"

    "text": "For data to be “spatial,” the observations must be explicitly tied to locations on the Earth’s surface. All spatial data has (or should have) a Coordinate Reference System (CRS), which describes the underlying system used to store location information in the data. Additionally, in QGIS, the Map Panel (canvas) has a CRS defined to display spatial data. It is important to understand that the CRS of the data and the Map Panel serve different (but linked) purposes.\nThe data for this demonstration are available here if you would like to follow along. Download the file GEOG510_demo2_data.zip to your hard drive (note where you downloaded the file!) and unzip it.\nNote that throughout this document, if I use the term “right click,” this means “control click” for Mac users!\n\n\nCRS of the Map Canvas\n\nOpen QGIS. In the top menu, select Project | New. Move your eyes to the Status bar, which is located at the bottom of the QGIS window. This area contains a decent amount of information about the properties of the Map canvas itself. Notice that, as you move the cursor within the Map canvas, that the location of the cursor is updated (Coordinate).\nNote that the Map canvas already has a CRS defined (bottom right of Status bar)! In this case, the CRS is EPSG:4326 (WGS 84).\n\n\n\nCRS of data layers\n\nIn the Browser panel, navigate to the folder GEOG510_demo2_data. Right click on the layer CA_tracts_albers located inside CA_tracts_albers.gpkg, and choose Layer Properties. In the Metadata tab, you can find the CRS information for this layer (EPSG:3310 - NAD83 / California Albers - Projected).\nRight click on the layer CA_vacc_15_wgs84.shp, and choose Layer Properties. Note that the CRS information for this layer is EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 - Geographic.\nIn Explorer or Finder, navigate to the folder GEOG510_demo2_data. Right/control click on the file CA_vacc_15_wgs84.prj and choose Open With (or similar). On Windows, open with Notepad. On Mac, open with Text Edit. What’s contained in this file?\n\n\n\nWorking with CRS in QGIS\n\nDrag the layer CA_tracts_albers located inside CA_tracts_albers.gpkg into the Layers panel or directly into the Map canvas. You may get a pop up window asking about a Transformation for the layer. If so, click OK. Now, look at the Status bar. What happened? The CRS of the Map canvas was redefined to match that of the data layer.\nDrag the layer CA_vacc_15_wgs84.shp into the Layers panel or directly into the Map canvas. QGIS has projected this layer “on the fly” meaning that, although the data are stored in the WGS 84 CRS, they are being displayed in the California Albers CRS.\nIn the top menu, go to View | Panels | Processing Toolbox. Expand the arrow next to Vector geometry and then click Add geometry attributes. Note the options for Calculate Using! Choose one and click okay. What happened?\nIn the Layers Panel, right click on CA_vacc_15_wgs84 and choose Export | Save Features As. Note the options for CRS. Choose Project CRS. Save as CA_vacc_15_albers.gpkg in the GEOG510_demo2_data folder.\nIn the Layers Panel, right click on CA_vacc_15_wgs84 and choose Layer CRS. Note the options… one important one is that you can change the Map canvas CRS to match one the layers! Choose Set Project CRS from Layer. What happened?\nYou can also change the Map canvas CRS by clicking on the CRS information in bottom right of Status bar… or by navigating to Project | Properties!"
