I am not an IT person, but I did manage to install these software packages on both his Mac and Windows computers. You can contact me if you are having issues, but please also feel free to reach out to USC IT desk for assistance.\nPlease note that GEOG 510 will not rely on ESRI software (ArcGIS or ArcPro). Instead, we will be using open-source software such as QGIS and R. The reasons for this change are many, but the most salient ones are 1) ESRI software still does not run on Mac computers (without the need for partitioning or installing a virtual machine), 2) the newest version of ESRI’s GIS software (ArcPro) is not as intuitive and is clunky (and QGIS has basically closed the gap on functionality and usability), and 3) GIS programming is becoming a required skill for just about any GIS user. Regardless of whatever software is used, the knowledge you gain in this course should not be tied to a specific software package."

Try a search such as, study area health data statistics. For example, michigan health data statistics. Other strings can be used such as, michigan reportable diseases data statistics.\nIf you are study a place in the US, you may want to try to include a “geography” identifer in the search, such as maryland county health data statistics, which turned up this link and this link which both appear very promising.\nIf you’ve already found spatial data and are trying to locate tabular data for a particular subject, use a search string with the word table and the geographic resolution (unit) of your spatial data included, e.g., study area topic unit table. For example, you could search for, england vaccination local authorities table.\nYou can also try this type of search for “country or region” data and add the government entity that would likely collect or distribute the data. For example, you could search for something similar to, Ecuador ministry of health statistics data.\n\n\n\nGoogle Dataset Search (link)\n\n\n\nOther Data\nPlease note that I have not worked with data from all of these sources, so I might not be able to offer much help with troubleshooting any issues you encounter when searching or downloading from some of the websites listed.

Working through these will be important so the class can move into some of the more advanced topics and uses of GIS by the end of the semester.\nI suggest that you complete each module assigned, but make your own decision on how much time to spend on each part given your prior GIS experience. For those of you with absolutely no GIS experience, I suggest diving in headfirst and working through every single step (time spent now will pay off later). For those of you with moderate to good GIS skills, make sure that you are at least skimming the reading within the module and completing all of the steps to brush up and ensure that you fill in any holes in your GIS knowledge. For GIS power users, I would suggest that (at the very least) you read through each module to make sure that you are familiar with all the operations and terminology included in each."

Do you now feel confident in your ability to add/load data layers? Did anything surprise you about working in QGIS?\n2. Module 4.1 (4.1.6) requires you to export the map you created as a graphics file. Export your map as a .jpg file and insert it into your answer document.\n3. In your own words (100-200 words), summarize and compare/contrast “Project on the Fly” in QGIS and changing/modifying the CRS of a spatial data layer (see Module 6.1).\n4. Module 6.2 required you to create multiple buffers (and use them to implement a distance-based analysis). Think of a health- or health care-related analysis where integrating buffers (or distance-based analysis such as that presented in 6.2) may provide useful/interesting results. Use the format in 6.2.2 to list potential criteria for your analysis.\n5. Now that you have had some initial GIS experience, describe a health-related research topic or problem that interests you and how you think GIS and/or geographic thinking can/should be integrated. This description can be mostly theoretical if you have no prior GIS/Geography experience. Try to stretch your ideas past simply “mapping the data” and descriptive analysis to consider how it can be used in explanation, prediction, or intervention.

    "section": "",
    "text": "An important part of learning GIS is understanding how files and digital data are stored and accessed by the GIS software. This short demonstration attempts to point out some of the particularities that you will encounter as you download, store, and manage spatial (and other) data files both within and outside the GIS software.\nThe data are available here for download if you would like to follow along. Download the file GEOG510_demo1_data.zip to your hard drive (note where you downloaded the file!) and unzip it.\nNote that throughout this document, I use the term “right click”. This means “control click” for Mac users!\n\n\nSpatial Data Layers/Files\n\nUsing Windows Explorer (NOT Internet Explorer) on Windows or Finder on Mac, navigate to the unzipped contents of GEOG510_demo1_data, click on the folder Relational/spatial, and view the files. What you are seeing is a single spatial data layer (a common but hopefully dying format known as a shapefile). Notice that the “stem” of the file names is the same for each file (with different file extensions or types). The data format has its own internal logic and GIS software knows how to handle these files.\nOpen QGIS. In the top menu, select Project | New. Locate the Browser panel. This is basically a simplistic file/folder manager within the QGIS environment. Navigate to the folder Relational/spatial. Notice the difference in how QGIS displays the shapefile tl_2016_06_tract_alb.shp (compared to Explorer or Finder). Right click on the layer and notice that there are a couple of “file management” type options available. Choose Layer Properties. Click on each tab.\nYou can also use the Browser panel to view/preview some non-spatial data file types. Navigate to Relational/attributes, right click on CA_kind_0015_clean_TCT_AllData.csv, and choose Layer Properties. This functionality can be highly useful if/when you are searching for the right file to use or if you have multiple csv files and cannot remember which one you need to work with.\nNow, in the Browser panel, navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Click the arrow next to CA_Vacc.gdb and note that it contains multiple layers (one spatial, one non-spatial). This spatial data type is called a geodatabase. It is like a container that can store multiple spatial data layers.\nIn Explorer or Finder, navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Notice that, at a file system level, a geodatabase is simply a folder containing .gdb in the folder name! Also note that the naming and organization structure of a geodatabase is quite complex (and not easy to understand).\nGo back to QGIS and, in the Browser panel, navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Click the arrow next to CA_vacc_geopackage.gpkg. This spatial data type is called a geopackage. It is like a container that can store multiple spatial data layers. This file has the same data contained within it as the geodatabase file.\nGo back to Explorer or Finder, navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Notice that, at a file system level, a geopackage is a single file.\n\n\nWhy is this important?\nGiven the semi complex nature of file/folder storage for spatial data layers, is very, very easy to make the files unusable if doing file/folder management manually using Explorer or Finder. If possible, use the Browser panel in QGIS to perform basic file/folder management duties. If using Explorer or Finder, take care to move all folders/files associated with each layer.\n\n\n\n\nData (non)Storage in QGIS\nAnother extremely important aspect of using QGIS is understanding how GIS software interacts with spatial (and other) data layers when performing mapping and analysis. There are two extremely important concepts to learn,\n\nWhen you add a data layer to the Layers panel of QGIS, this is simply creating a link to where the layer is stored on your hard drive. The data layer does not move on your computer. The contents of the layer are not stored inside of QGIS. The software simply creates a link to the layer’s location.\nA QGIS project file (.qgz) can be used to save display properties, layer order, map layouts, and preferences… but it does not contain/store the actual spatial data layers.\n\n\nIn QGIS, add Object_Rel/CA_Vacc_geopackage.gpkg/tl_2016_06_tract_alb to the Layers panel using drag and drop from the Browser panel. If you get a pop up window asking about the geographic transformation, choose the default option. The layer should display in the map panel.\nIn the Layers panel, right click on tl_2016_06_tract_alb and choose Properties. If the Information tab (on the left) is not selected, click on it. Note that the Path to the file containing the data is shown (along with other basic information about the data). Click OK on the Layer Properties window.\nIn the top menu, choose Project | Save As. Save as File_paths_test.qgz in the Object_Rel folder.\nClose QGIS.\nGo to Explorer or Finder and navigate to the folder Object_Rel. Move the file File_paths_test.qgz from the Object_Rel folder to the Relational folder.\nOnce it is moved, double click on File_paths_test.qgz. You should get a pop up window named Handle Unavailable Layers. Click on tl_2016_06_tract_alb and click the Browse button. Navigate to Object_Rel and click on CA_Vacc_geopackage.gpkg. Click Apply Changes.\n\n\nWhat happened?\nWhen File_paths_test.qgz was moved on the hard drive, the link between this file and the data layers was broken. Remember, when adding a layer, QGIS only creates a link to the layer’s location. As such, if either the .qgz or the data layers file is moved, this link will be broken! QGIS uses relative file paths, meaning the data location are stored in relation to where the .qgz file is stored. In this case, as long as the file path between from the .qgz file to the spatial data layer files is not changed, the software will always be able to find the file.\n\n\n\nIn the top menu, choose Project | Save. Close QGIS.\nIn Explorer or Finder create a new folder called QGIS_test and move the Object_Rel and Relational folders inside of this new folder. Navigate to the Relational folder and double click on File_paths_test.qgz. What happened and why?"

    "text": "For data to be “spatial,” the observations must be explicitly tied to locations on the Earth’s surface. All spatial data has (or should have) a Coordinate Reference System (CRS), which describes the underlying system used to store location information in the data. Additionally, in QGIS, the Map Panel (canvas) has a CRS defined to display spatial data. It is important to understand that the CRS of the data and the Map Panel serve different (but linked) purposes.\nThe data for this demonstration are available here if you would like to follow along. Download the file GEOG510_demo2_data.zip to your hard drive (note where you downloaded the file!) and unzip it.\nNote that throughout this document, if I use the term “right click,” this means “control click” for Mac users!\n\n\nCRS of the Map Canvas\n\nOpen QGIS. In the top menu, select Project | New. Move your eyes to the Status bar, which is located at the bottom of the QGIS window. This area contains a decent amount of information about the properties of the Map canvas itself. Notice that, as you move the cursor within the Map canvas, that the location of the cursor is updated (Coordinate).\nNote that the Map canvas already has a CRS defined (bottom right of Status bar)! In this case, the CRS is EPSG:4326 (WGS 84).\n\n\n\nCRS of data layers\n\nIn the Browser panel, navigate to the folder GEOG510_demo2_data. Right click on the layer CA_tracts_albers located inside CA_tracts_albers.gpkg, and choose Layer Properties. In the Metadata tab, you can find the CRS information for this layer (EPSG:3310 - NAD83 / California Albers - Projected).\nRight click on the layer CA_vacc_15_wgs84.shp, and choose Layer Properties. Note that the CRS information for this layer is EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 - Geographic.\nIn Explorer or Finder, navigate to the folder GEOG510_demo2_data. Right/control click on the file CA_vacc_15_wgs84.prj and choose Open With (or similar). On Windows, open with Notepad. On Mac, open with Text Edit. What’s contained in this file?\n\n\n\nWorking with CRS in QGIS\n\nDrag the layer CA_tracts_albers located inside CA_tracts_albers.gpkg into the Layers panel or directly into the Map canvas. You may get a pop up window asking about a Transformation for the layer. If so, click OK. Now, look at the Status bar. What happened? The CRS of the Map canvas was redefined to match that of the data layer.\nDrag the layer CA_vacc_15_wgs84.shp into the Layers panel or directly into the Map canvas. QGIS has projected this layer “on the fly” meaning that, although the data are stored in the WGS 84 CRS, they are being displayed in the California Albers CRS.\nIn the top menu, go to View | Panels | Processing Toolbox. Expand the arrow next to Vector geometry and then click Add geometry attributes. Note the options for Calculate Using! Choose one and click okay. What happened?\nIn the Layers Panel, right click on CA_vacc_15_wgs84 and choose Export | Save Features As. Note the options for CRS. Choose Project CRS. Save as CA_vacc_15_albers.gpkg in the GEOG510_demo2_data folder.\nIn the Layers Panel, right click on CA_vacc_15_wgs84 and choose Layer CRS. Note the options… one important one is that you can change the Map canvas CRS to match one the layers! Choose Set Project CRS from Layer. What happened?\nYou can also change the Map canvas CRS by clicking on the CRS information in bottom right of Status bar… or by navigating to Project | Properties!"

If it isn’t click the check box next to it, then click the Close button. Note that you now have an option for MMQGIS in the top menu!\n\n\nWhere’s my plugin?\nThe location of the functions/operations provided in a QGIS plugin varies by the plugin. For example, the MMQGIS plugin adds a completely new option to the top menu, whereas other may add a set of functions under a submenu such as Vector | PLUGIN. Generally, this information can be found on the plugin summary at Plugins | Manage and Install Plugins.\n\n\n\nGeocode data from a .csv file\nWithin QGIS, MMQGIS provides an option to geocode address locations stored in a .csv file. This is a pretty standard functionality provided by most GIS softwares.\n\nNavigate to https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8fc9c089c11a4913b0768381fa07bf6d_0. Click the Download button, scroll down to GeoJSON, and click the Download button. Save the file as MI_County.geojson to your hard drive (a great place to save would be your GEOG 510 folder).\nDownload GEOG510_demo3_data.zip here. A great place to save would be your GEOG 510 folder.\nAdd MI_County.geojson to the Layers panel. Shield eyes… ouch, that is a nasty CRS (we’ll deal with that later).\nIn the top menu, navigate to MMQGIS | Geocode | Geocode CSV with Web Service. Choose MIhospitals-for-geocoding.csv from the downloaded GEOG510_demo3_data folder as the input. QGIS attemps to find the correct fields for Address, City, and State (here, this was easy). For Web Service, choose OpenStreetMap / Nominatim. Note that the option to enter API Key does not work. For Output File Name, click the little button with three dots and Save As MIhospitals-for-geocoding.gpkg in the same location you saved the .csv file. For Not Found Output List, Save As MIhospitals-for-geocoding-notfound.csv in the same location you saved the .csv file. Click Apply. The process will likely take a few minutes. The result should be added to the Layers panel. How many of the hospitals were geocoded? Click ‘Close’.\nChange the CRS to Michigan GeoRef.\nOpen the attribute table of the geocoded layer MIhospitals-for-geocoding. Note the “display_name” and type” fields. These contain some important information about the quality of the results! Close the attribute table, then click “Zoom to Layer” on MIhospitals-for-geocoding. What do we notice? (use Identify tool)\nAdd MIhospitals-for-geocoding-notfound.csv to the Layers panel. These are the features that could not be geocoded."

How many were not?\n\n\nTable Join\nNote that NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded.gpkg only has location information. This isn’t super useful as/is. However, we do have the number of beds at each facility stored in a .csv file, which we can append to the geocoded locations using a table join.\n\nRight click on NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded and choose Properties. In the menu on the left, choose Joins. Click on the little green “plus” button at the bottom. For Join Layer, choose NC_Psych_Hosps_Beds. The key fields are the Join field and the Target field. Choose the correct fields for the join (ID and ID). Leave everything else unchanged and click OK.\nOpen the attribute table of NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded and note the appended information!\n\n\n\nField Calculator\n\nRight click on NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded and choose Properties. In the menu on the left, choose Fields.\n\nQ2: What ‘Type’ is the “NC_Psych_Hosps_Beds_PSYCHBEDS” field stored as? Is this a nominal, ordinal, or an integer/ratio variable? If we were to calculate the average number of beds in NC hospitals using this field, would we able to do that or not? Why or why not?\nQGIS does not do a great job reading in data types in .csv files. Thus, the psychiatric bed information that was appended to the spatial features using the table join is not quite usable yet (beds are stored as character data)! In the next step, you will create a new numeric field in the NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded layer to store this information.Click the Field Calculator button (at the top, with colored dots on it).\n\nIn the Field Calculator window, make sure Create a new field is selected. In Output field name, put BEDS. In the Output field type, choose Whole number (integer 32 bit is ok). In the Expression area type or copy/paste: \"NC_Psych_Hosps_Beds_PSYCHBEDS\" (or find this in Fields and Values and double click the correct field). Click OK.\nOpen the attribute table of NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded and note the appended information!\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Join\nQ3: By looking at the attribute table of NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded, can we determine the county that each facility is located in? Why would we need to use a spatial join here as compared to tabular join? \n\nIn the top menu, navigate to Vector | Data Management Tools | Join Attributes by Location. The “Join to features in” layer is the layer that will be “receiving” the information. The “By comparing to” layer is the layer providing the information. In this case, the “Join to features in” layer should be NC_Psych_Hosps_osm_geocoded and the “By comparing to” layer should be NC_counties. For Features they (geometric predicate), intersect should be selected (this will assign information to each point from each polygon). In this case, you can simply create a temporary layer. Leave everything else as it is and Click Run.\n\nQ4: How many columns does the new joined layer has? (Note: you can take a look by right clicking the layer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Information and looking at the Fields metadata)\nQ5: Which county has the hospital with the highest number of beds?)\n\nNote that while we used the default QGIS tools for creating a new field and conducting joins, you can also the MMQGIS package which is even more intuitive.

    "text": "Part #1\n\nGeocoding\nIn the next section, you will be geocoding the location of Michigan acute care hospitals using two different geocoders. Then, you will perform both a table and spatial join to add attribute values to the hospital location data.\n\n\nGeocoding using an online geocoding service\nThe US Census Bureau provides a free, online geocoder for addresses in the US, Puerto Rico, and the US Island Areas. You can geocode up to 10,000 addresses per submission.\n\nNavigate to the Census Geocoder page. In the top menu, choose Find Locations | Batch Address Processing. There is a specific format you need to follow when submitting data (a csv file must not have a header row and must have the following fields: ID, Address, City, State, and Zip). Fortunately for you, I am a kind professor and have provided you with a file that conforms to this format. Click on the Browse button, and then choose MIhospitals.csv. The Benchmark should be Public_AR_Current. Click the Get Results button and save your geocoded output file in your data folder as MIhospitals_census_geocoded.csv.\n\n\n\n\nImport X,Y data into QGIS\nNow, you will convert the tabular data (containing the geocoded locations from the Census Bureau) into a spatial data file in QGIS. Remember, tables are not spatial data files… even if they contain spatial information. Some processing is required to define the numbers found in the tables as coordinate locations on Earth’s surface.\n\nThe output file from the US Census requires some light data wrangling before it can be read/used in QGIS. Open MIhospitals_census_geocoded.csv using Excel or some other spreadsheet-like software (but the instructions are based on Excel). Insert two new (blank) columns to the right of the field containing the coordinate locations (the coordinate locations should be in the F column if viewing the file in Excel).\nIn the first row, in the first blank cell (cell G1), type =TEXTSPLIT(F1, \",\"), then hit the return key. If done correctly, G1 should contain the value before the comma in F1 and H1 should contain the value after the comma in F1. Copy/paste to the rest of the rows. Delete the formula from all rows without a value in F, e.g., F4, F79, etc.\nAdd a blank row above the first row and insert the following values in the new row (this will function as the header row or column names when importing):\n\nFAC_ID,ADDRESS,GC_RESULT,GC_TYPE,GC_ADDRESS,GC_LOCATION,LONGITUDE,LATITUDE,TIGER_ID,TIGER_SIDE\n\nSave the file and close Excel.\nOpen QGIS and create a new project. Open the Data Source Manager (button on the menu bar or in the top menu Layer | Data Source Manager). In the Data Source Manager, click on Delimited Text in the menu on the left. Use the following options:\n\nFor File name, use the three dots button and navigate to Mihospitals_census_geocoded.csv\nUnder Geometry Definition, make sure the LONGITUDE is selected for X field and LATITUDE is selected for Y field. For Geometry CRS, choose EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 (this is the CRS used by the US Census Bureau for the results).\nLeave all other options on their default settings, then click Add.\n\n\nYou should now see the points displayed in the map canvas and have a point layer called MIhospitals_census_geocoded in the Layers panel. This layer is simply held in temporary memory; thus, it is good practice to actually create a new permanent file that will store this layer.\n\nTo do so, right click on MIhospitals_census_geocoded and choose Export | Save Features As. Save the file as MIhospitals_census_geocoded.gpkg in your correct folder (it should be added to the Layers panel after you click OK). Remove the “csv version” of MIhospitals_census_geocoded from the Layers panel.\n\n\n\n\nGeocoding inside of QGIS using MMQGIS\nNext, you will geocode the same original data using QGIS.\n\nUse the instructions provided in the QGIS Plugins and Geocoding In Class Demonstration (#4) to install and activate the MMQGIS plugin.\nAdd MIhospitals_with_header.csv to the Layers panel in QGIS.\nIn the top menu, navigate to MMQGIS | Geocode | Geocode CSV with Web Service. Choose MIhospitals_with_header.csv as the input. QGIS attemps to find the correct fields for Address, City, and State (verify this worked). For Web Service, choose OpenStreetMap / Nominatim. For Output File Name, click the little button with three dots and Save As MIhospitals_osm_geocoded.gpkg. For Not Found Output List, Save As MIhospitals_osm_geocoded_notfound.csv. Click Apply. The process will likely take a few minutes to complete (just hold tight until you see the results appear in the Layers panel).\nAdd MI_counties to the Layers panel (it’s okay if you get a warning about the CRS!… it is just a warning). Arrange the layers so that the county polygons are not covering the points.\nChange the CRS of the map canvas to Michigan GeoRef (NAD83 / Michigan Oblique Mercator, EPSG:3078).\nNow would be a good time to save your project file, which saves your progress thus far. Go to Project | Save As and save your project as assignment2_geocode.qgs.\nUsing the Map Composer, make a map that highlights at least 3-4 locations that are different between the two geocoded results. Click here for the QGIS tutorial. Use the following for guidance:\n\nMake sure you choose symbols for the two hospital layers that are distinguishable.\nTurn on Labels for MI_osm_geocode layer (use the field, FAC_ID).\nUse the layer MI_Counties as the base layer for Michigan (use light fill and line colors)\n\nMake sure the map has a title, legend, scale bar, north arrow, and your name!\nMake sure that you try to make something that looks visually pleasing (colors are good, elements are aligned, layout is balanced, etc).\nWhen complete, export your map using userid_assignment2_map1.pdf.\n\nClose the Map Composer. Save your project file, then close QGIS.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Pre-processing\nWe often have to do a number of steps to make our data manageable and mappable. In the next section, you will remove extraneous information from the attribute table of the new spatial features you just created. Then, you will join information from a table to that file and create a map.\n\nOpen QGIS and create a new project. Add MIhospitals_census_geocoded to the Layers panel. Change the CRS of the map canvas to Michigan GeoRef (NAD83 / Michigan Oblique Mercator, EPSG:3078).\n\n\n\nDelete fields in attribute table\nIt is very important to note that the next step is a destructive editing step. It edits the original file and there’s no recovering the original information. If you are not sure that you are okay with this, make a copy of the original file first (right click on the layer in the Layers panel and choose Export | Save Features As).\n\nRight click on MIhospitals_census_geocoded and choose Properties. In the menu on the left, choose Fields. Click on the little button that looks like a pencil to toggle editing ON/OFF. Click on the fields that you want to delete (using control/command clicking)… in this case, you can delete GC_ADDRESS, GC_LOCATION, TIGER_ID, and TIGER_SIDE. When ready, click the Delete Field button (with a little red X). Click the button to toggle editing back to OFF. Save your edits. Click OK.\nNow would be a good time to save your project file, which saves your progress thus far. Go to Project | Save As and save your project as assignment2_tablejoin.qgs.\n\n\n\n\nTable Join\nA table join allows you to merge information from two separate layers/tables based on a common ID value. In QGIS, these can occur between/among spatial and non-spatial data layers. Table joins are one of most common data preparation steps using in GIS.\n\nAdd MI_hosp_attributes.csv to the Layers panel. This table contains the attributes that you will be joining to the features in the MIhospitals_census_geocoded layer. Open both attribute tables and inspect the available fields. Identify the key field you will be using for the join.\nRight click on MIhospitals_census_geocoded and choose Properties. In the menu on the left, choose Joins. Click on the little green “plus” button at the bottom. For Join Layer, choose MI_hosp_attributes. The key fields are the Join field and the Target field. Choose the correct fields for the join. Leave everything else unchanged and click OK.\nOpen the attribute table of MIhospitals_census_geocoded and note the joined fields. If you scroll down in the attribute table, you should notice that some of the hospitals have NULL values in the joined fields. This is because there was not a “matching” or “corresponding” entry for these features in the MI_hosp_attributes.csv file. This is okay for the purposes of this lab. However, it is good practice to always check the output of a table join to ensure that nothing fishy happened during the join. A simple way to do this when you have a lot of features (and you don’t feel like manually checking each of them) is to perform an attribute query on one of the joined fields. Close the attribute table.\n\n\nTable joins are not permanent\nA table join is not a permanent operation. The joined data only exists in temporary memory in QGIS. Sometimes this is a good thing… because you might only need the joined data for a single map or operation. Other times, you might be building a layer that you will need multiple times in the future. To make the join permanent, right click on the layer in the Layer panel and export as a new file.\n\n\nYou are required to make a Graduated Symbol map of Michigan’s hospital sizes. However, QGIS read in the attribute data for the hospitals as “character” data type rather than “numeric” (character data is not recognized as numeric). So, you will calculate a new numeric field for use in mapping.\n\nRight click on MIhospitals_census_geocoded and choose Properties. In the menu on the left, choose Fields. Click the Field Calculator button (looks like some colored dots). In the Field Calculator window, make sure Create a new field is selected. In Output field name, put BEDS. In the Expression area, type or copy/paste: to_real(\"MI_hosp_attributes_BEDS\"). Click OK.\nUsing the Map Composer, create a Graduated Symbol map of Michigan’s hospital sizes using the BEDS field (the number of beds at each hospital). Use the following for guidance:\n\nThe entire state should be on the map\nDo not use Labels.\nUse the layer MI_Counties as the base layer for Michigan.\nMake sure the map has a title, legend, scale bar, north arrow, and your name!\nMake sure that you try to make something that looks visually pleasing (colors are good, elements are aligned, layout is balanced, etc).\nWhen complete, export your map using userid_assignment2_map2.pdf.\n\nClose the Map Composer. Save your project file and then close QGIS.\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Join\nA spatial join allows you to transfer attribute information from one spatial layer to another based on shared location. In this section, you will be performing a spatial join to assign population data to a Zip Code layer for mapping purposes. This section also begins the process of illustrating how multiple operations must be performed to complete an analysis.\n\nSince you spent a lot of time creating a nice Michigan map layout in the previous section, you should use that hard work and effort again. Open QGIS and navigate to Project | Open, then open assignment2_tablejoin.qgs. Remove all the layers that were loaded in the Layers panel, then add the MI_zipcodes.gpkg and MI_block_pop.gpkg layers. The Zip Code layer is a polygon layer representing the areal extent of Zip Codes. The Block population layer is a point layer of the Census Block centroids and contains population information in the field POP (note: this layer has a lot of points in it, you may want to make it not visible). Go to Project | Save As and save the project as assignment2_spatialjoin.qgs.\n\n\nRecycling map layouts\nTo save time, I often spend a lot of time on my first “study area” map, especially if I know that I will be creating numerous maps of the same region. Then, I just reuse that project file and map composition (save with a new name) as a template.\n\n\nYou will now spatially join the population information in the MI_block_pop layer to the MI_zipcodes layer. This operation uses shared “location” to transfer attributes. In this case, each Zip Code will be receiving population information from the Block points that fall inside it.\n\nWe need a tool that is available in the Processing Toolbox to join and summarize information simultaneously. To open the Processing Toolbox, in the top menu navigate to View | Panels | Processing Toolbox. In the Processing Toolbox, under Vector General, double click on Join Attributes by Location (summary).\nThe Base Layer is the layer that will be “receiving” the information. The Join Layer is the layer providing the information. In this case, the Base Layer should be MI_zipcodes and the Join Layer should be MI_block_pop. Click the little wrench next to the Join Layer and change the option for Invalid feature filtering to Do Not Filter (there are a few Zip Code polygons that may cause this process to fail if not ignored). For Geometric predicate, intersects should be selected (this will assign information for points falling inside each polygon). For Fields to summarise, choose POP. For Summaries to Calculate, choose sum. Save as a new file, MI_zipcodes_pop.gpkg.\n\nOpen the attribute table of MI_zipcodes_pop. Note that there is now a field called POP_sum. This is the sum of the block population points falling in each Zip Code. Now, you will import hospital utilization data, join it to your new Zip Code layer (with population information), and calculate a new field containing the hospital utilization rate (epidemiologists, we can call this a rate because it is utilization over a year).\n\nAdd MI_PD.csv to the Layer panel. The field PD contains the number of patient days spent in a hospital for residents of each Zip Code (measured during a calendar year). A patient day is equal to one person staying one night in the hospital. Use a table join (see Steps 19-20) to join the patient day table to the MI_zipcodes_pop layer you created in the previous step. After the table join, open the attribute table and verify that you now have patient days and population for each Zip Code.\nUse the Field Calculator to make the utilization rate calculation by dividing the number of patient days by the population for each Zip Code (see Step 22). In the Field Calculator window, make sure Create a new field is selected. In Output field name, put PD_rate. In the Output field type, choose Decimal number. In the Expression area, type or copy/paste: \"MI_PD_PD\" / \"POP_sum\". Click OK.\nUsing the Map Layout you already created in the Map Composer, create a Choropleth map of Michigan’s patient day utilization rate by Zip Code. Use the utilization rate field that you just calculated (PD_rate). Use the following for guidance:\n\nThe entire state should be on the map\nDo not use Labels.\nMake sure the map has a title, legend, scale bar, north arrow, and your name!\nMake sure that you try to make something that looks visually pleasing (colors are good, elements are aligned, layout is balanced, etc).\nWhen complete, export your map using Lastname_GEOG541_Assignment2_Map3.pdf."
