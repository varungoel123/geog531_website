I am not an IT person, but I did manage to install these software packages on both his Mac and Windows computers. You can contact me if you are having issues, but please also feel free to reach out to USC IT desk for assistance.\nPlease note that GEOG 510 will not rely on ESRI software (ArcGIS or ArcPro). Instead, we will be using open-source software such as QGIS and R. The reasons for this change are many, but the most salient ones are 1) ESRI software still does not run on Mac computers (without the need for partitioning or installing a virtual machine), 2) the newest version of ESRI’s GIS software (ArcPro) is not as intuitive and is clunky (and QGIS has basically closed the gap on functionality and usability), and 3) GIS programming is becoming a required skill for just about any GIS user. Regardless of whatever software is used, the knowledge you gain in this course should not be tied to a specific software package."

This could be a good place to begin your search though.)\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Search Tips For Health Data\nIf you’re trying to fnd health related data, remember that it pretty unlikely that you will find the health data as a spatial data layer. Try a search such as, study area health data statistics. For example, michigan health data statistics. Other strings can be used such as, michigan reportable diseases data statistics.\nIf you are study a place in the US, you may want to try to include a “geography” identifer in the search, such as maryland county health data statistics, which turned up this link and this link which both appear very promising.\nIf you’ve already found spatial data and are trying to locate tabular data for a particular subject, use a search string with the word table and the geographic resolution (unit) of your spatial data included, e.g., study area topic unit table. For example, you could search for, england vaccination local authorities table.\nYou can also try this type of search for “country or region” data and add the government entity that would likely collect or distribute the data. For example, you could search for something similar to, Ecuador ministry of health statistics data.\n\n\n\nGoogle Dataset Search (link)\n\n\n\nOther Data\nPlease note that I have not worked with data from all of these sources, so I might not be able to offer much help with troubleshooting any issues you encounter when searching or downloading from some of the websites listed.
