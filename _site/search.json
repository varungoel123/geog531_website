    "text": "This document contains a number of resources that will (hopefully) assist you in accessing the software we will be using throughout the course. Dr. D is not an IT person, but he did manage to install these software packages on both his Mac and Windows computers. You can contact him if you are having issues, but please also feel free to reach out to UNC ITS for assistance.\nIn a departure from prior versions of the course, GEOG 541 will not rely on ESRI software (ArcGIS or ArcPro). We will be using QGIS and R. The reasons for this change are many, but the most salient ones are 1) ESRI software still does not run on Mac computers, 2) the newest version of ESRI’s GIS software (ArcPro) is not good software (QGIS has basically closed the gap on functionality and usability), 3) GIS programming is becoming a required skill for just about any GIS user, and 4) the knowledge you gain in this course should not be tied to a specific software package."
