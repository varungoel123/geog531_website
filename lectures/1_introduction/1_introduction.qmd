## What is your experience level with R? {.smaller}

![](assets/r_experience.png){fig-align="center" width="500px"}

## R

-   Programming Language written by Statisticians primarily for statistical computing

-   Big community and support

-   Suitable for Geographic Research

    -   

        ```         
        Very strong spatial statistics capabilities
        ```

    -   

        ```         
        Great data visualization + mapping
        ```

    -   

        ```         
        Supported by packages (similar to libraries in Python)
        ```

## R Studio, Posit Cloud

-   R Studio: Integrated Development Environment for R

    -   

        ```         
        Makes Dull R more Fun
        ```

-   Posit Cloud: Rstudio in the cloud

    -   

        ```         
        Reduces steep learning curve
        ```

    -   

        ```         
        Reduces technical issues
        ```
