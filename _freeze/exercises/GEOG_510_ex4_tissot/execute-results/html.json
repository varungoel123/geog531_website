Navigate to <https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/esri::world-countries-generalized/about>. Click the **Download** button, scroll down to GeoJSON, and click the **Download** button. Save the file as **World_Countries.geojson** to your hard drive (a great place to save would be your GEOG 510 folder).\n\n2.  Navigate to <https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/esri::world-latitude-and-longitude-grids/explore?layer=0>. Click the **Download** button, scroll down to GeoJSON, and click the **Download** button. Save the file as **World_Grid.geojson** to your hard drive (a great place to save would be your GEOG 510 folder).\n\n3.  Now, [download Tissot.gpkg here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rCVyFBVBMC8mwW6P-be7UbFjmR9kfIRj/view?usp=sharing). A great place to save would be your GEOG 510 folder.\n\n### Add Data Layers\n\n4.  Open QGIS. In the top menu, select Project \\| New.\n\n5.  Add World_Countries.geojson to the Layers panel (you can do this by dragging from the Browser panel or clicking the Open Data Source Manager button).\n\n6.  Add World_Grid.geojson to the Layers panel (you can do this by dragging from the Browser panel or clicking the Open Data Source Manager button).\n\n7.  Add Tissot.gpkg to the Layers panel (you can do this by dragging from the Browser panel or clicking the Open Data Source Manager button).\n\n**Q1. Open a new word file, and take a screenshot of your map and paste it. In 1-2 sentences, describe what the various sizes and shapes of the circle might tell you about the projection. Does, it preserve area, shape, both, neither?**\n\n### Change Projection\n\n8.  Change the projection of the Map Panel to any equal area projection! What do you notice?\n\n**Q2. Take a screenshot of your map and paste it. In 1-2 sentences, describe what the various sizes and shapes of the circle might tell you about the projection. Does, it preserve area, shape, both, neither?**\n\n9.  Change the projection of the Map Panel to any conformal projection! What do you notice?\n\n**Q3. Take a screenshot of your map and paste it. In 1-2 sentences, describe what the various sizes and shapes of the circle might tell you about the projection. Does, it preserve area, shape, both, neither?**\n\nSubmission instruction. Save your word file as \"username_ex2.docx\" and upload it to your relevant OneDrive folder.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
