Open a word doc, save it as 'youruserid_ex7.docx' and answer the following questions.\n\n**Note that throughout this document, if I use the term \"right click,\" this means \"control click\" for Mac users!**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Data\n\n1.  [Download the data here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OBgOwYhjag9dv0_cShenVY5ahOH6AmlA/view?usp=sharing) and unzip.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Open GeoDa and Load Data\n\n2.  Open GeoDa. Create a new project and load data by navigating in the top menu to File \\| New (or click the button that looks like a folder) and choosing NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.gpkg from the exercise7 data folder (or by dragging the file into the specified area from Finder/Explorer). This layer contains incident cases of Lyme Disease by Zip Code over the years 2016-2018 in North Carolina.\n\n3.  The button to see the attribute table looks like a table and should be the fourth one from the right on the GeoDa toolbar. Open the attribute table for NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.gpkg. Note that each observation has a Zip Code, name, population count (`pop20`), and count of Lyme Disease cases over this period (`cases`).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Map and Calculate Incidence Rate\n\n4.  Navigate to Map \\| Rates-Calculated Map \\| Empirical Bayes (or right click in the map area and choose Rates \\| Empirical Bayes). Choose cases for the Event Variable and pop for the Base Variable, and then change the Map Themes to Natural Breaks and the number of Categories to 5. Click OK. [**Take a screenshot of this map and paste it in your word file. It will come handy when answering questions later.**]{.underline}\n\n5.  Write the Empirical Bayes Rates to the attribute table of NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018.gpkg, right click in the map and choose Save Rates (you can leave the default name).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Define Neighbors\n\nPrior to completing any spatial autocorrelation analysis, we need to define our neighborhood (allows us to compare between things that are \"near\").\n\n6.  Click the Weights button on the toolbar (the big W) or navigate in the top menu to Tools \\| Weights Manager. In the Weights Manager popup window, click Create (since we don't have any created yet). Use zip_code as the ID Variable. Choose 1st order, Queen contiguity weights (should be the default). Click Create and save the weights to the same location as NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018_Queen_1.gal in the exercise #9 data folder. NOTE: you will get a warning about a neighborliness observation, that is okay!\n\n7.  GeoDa provides some basic information and a few tools to explore the nature of the neighborhood definition via the weights manager.\n\n[**Q1. What is the average number of neighbors given 1st order, Queen contiguity?** ]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Global Spatial Autocorrelation\n\nWe use *global* spatial autocorrelation metrics to answer the question, \"considering all the observations (values), is the overall pattern clustered, random, or dispersed?\" You will now answer this question for Lyme Disease incidence rates in NC.\n\n8.  Calculate Moran's I. To do this, in the top menu, click on **Space \\| Univariate Moran's I**. **Choose R_EBS** (Empirical Bayes smoothed rates) as the First variable, as we are testing the spatial pattern of the rates of Lyme Disease. Make sure NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018_Queen_1 is selected for the weights. Click OK. *NOTE: Because some of the tracts do not have any contiguous neighbors, you should get a warning stating this. This is okay.*\n\n9.  You should get a popup window containing a Moran's I scatterplot with the Moran's I value at the top. To run a hypothesis test (and get a p-value) comparing the results to a null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness (CSR), right click anywhere inside the Moran's I window and choose **Randomization \\| 999 Permutations**. You should get another popup window that contains the pseudo p-value based on the value of your data compared to the random permutations.\n\n[**Q.2 What is the Moran's I value and pseudo p-value? What is your interpretation of this output? (less than 100 words)**]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Local Spatial Autocorrelation\n\nWe often want to understand spatial autocorrelation at a regional level. We use local spatial autocorrelation metrics (e.g., LISA, Getis Ord G\\*) to accomplish this. These methods produce a measure of autocorrelation for each observation in your data, thus allowing you to identify hotspots and coldspots, as well as spatial outlier values.\n\n10. In the top menu, click on **Space \\| Univariate Local Moran's I**. Choose **R_EBS (Empirical Bayes smoothed rates)** as the First variable, as we are testing the spatial pattern of the rates of Lyme Disease. Make sure NC_ZIP_Lyme_2016_2018_Queen_1 is selected for the weights. Click OK. You will get a popup window asking “What windows to open?”. Make sure that all options are selected and click OK.\n\n11. Right click in one of the pop up maps. Change the [**Significance Filter from 0.05 to 0.01**]{.underline}. Note that the number of Zip Codes highlighted in both maps change!\n\n[**Q.3) Paste this map (screenshot is ok) into your word file. How many Zip Codes were identified as being in a High High cluster? How many in a Low Low cluster? Provide a short explanation (less than 100 words) of why one would expect the pattern of High High observations and Low High outliers given the original choropleth map?** ]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12. Now, create a new set of weights using a choice of distance weights (distance threshold or K-nearest neighbors. For distance threshold, make sure to choose a distance above the minimum threshold, and for K-nearest neighbors, choose a number between 4-10.\n\n[**Q4-6. Answer Q1-3 again but using the new chosen weights.**]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n13. Save your file with your answer and upload to your relevant OneDrive folder.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
